"""Axiom-closure gate for the frozen manifest.

`check_manifest.py` counts `sorry` tokens per file.  That is not enough: a file
can contain no `sorry` and still depend on one transitively, through an import
of another node that is still a draft.  `Rotor.Frozen.insertion_inequality` was
exactly that -- zero `sorry`s of its own, `sorryAx` in its axiom closure.

A node may be SEALED only if `#print axioms` on its export shows no `sorryAx`.
This runs Lean and is the authority; the token count is only a fast prefilter.

Usage: check_axioms.py [--emit]   (--emit rewrites `state:` in the manifest)
