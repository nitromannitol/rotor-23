"""Check that every constant depends only on the dimension.

The paper's constants are always "depending only on `d`".  In Lean that is a
property of quantifier order: the existential must be bound before `β` and
before `n`.  Writing

    theorem foo {d : ℕ} (hd : 2 ≤ d) {β : ℝ} (hβ : 1 ≤ β) : ∃ c, ... β ... n ...

reads as `∀ β, ∃ c(β)`, which lets the constant absorb any power of `β` and
makes a factor like `β^{-d/(d+1)}` decorative -- the statement would hold with
the wrong exponent.  That is a silent weakening, invisible to every other check
here, so it gets its own.

The rule enforced: in a frozen statement that binds a real-valued existential,
none of `β`, `n`, `k`, `m`, `h` may be a *parameter* of the theorem; they must be
quantified inside the conclusion, after the existential.  Only `d` may be a
parameter, which is what the paper's own convention allows: "`c > 0` and
`C < ∞` are constants that depend only on `d` ... They never depend on `β`, `k`,
`m`, or `n`."
