/-!
The doubled closed walk `2a, a + b, 2b, …` of a closed lattice walk, on which the sides of a
simple curve are the odd-odd points next to the midpoints of its edges: for a step `a → b`
with direction `d`, the left point is `a + b + rotL d` and the right point `a + b + rotR d`,
and the winding number of the doubled walk is larger by one on the left
(`wind_dbl_left_sub_right`).  These points are never on the doubled walk, whose points have
an even coordinate.
