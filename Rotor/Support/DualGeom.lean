Geometry of the dual edges used by the exploration (`rotor.tex:1517-1556`, `1885-1900`):
every directed dual edge between adjacent faces is `dualEdge v a` for its primal tail `v`
and primal direction `a`; the four sides of the square at `v` are the four dual edges
`dualEdge v k`, with distinct bonds; the edges leaving a face (`edgesFrom`) and the
continuations after an open test (`continuations`) are adjacent, distinct, and avoid the
reverse edge.
