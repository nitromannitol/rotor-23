# Comparator runs

The official `leanprover/comparator` was run on every pair in this directory on 2026-09-24, at commit `b9303b6`, on a local machine. Each pair was checked twice: once with the Lean kernel, and once more with the independent `nanoda` kernel enabled (a temporary copy of `comparator.json` with `"enable_nanoda": true`). The committed configurations keep `enable_nanoda` false so that a reproduction needs only three tools.

| Pair | Lean kernel | Lean and nanoda kernels |
|---|---|---|
| `PendantCounterexample` | passed (124 s) | passed (153 s) |
| `MainDegreeThree` | passed (214 s) | passed (242 s) |
| `MainSquare` | passed (265 s) | passed (330 s) |
| `PerturbationsDegreeThree` | passed (182 s) | passed (243 s) |
| `PerturbationsSquare` | passed (238 s) | passed (353 s) |

A pass means the comparator printed `Your solution is okay!`: the solution proves a theorem whose statement and full dependency closure match the challenge's, using only the permitted axioms.

To reproduce one pair, from the repository root:

```
COMPARATOR_LANDRUN=<landrun> COMPARATOR_LEAN4EXPORT=<lean4export> \
  lake env <comparator>/.lake/build/bin/comparator Audit/<Pair>/comparator.json
```
